# Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning

In the realm of healthcare, early detection is everything. This project leverages the power of Deep Learning to classify brain tumors into four distinct types: **glioma**, **meningioma**, **no tumor**, and **pituitary**, based on the Kaggle Brain Tumor dataset.

## Why This Project Matters

Brain tumors can have life-altering consequences if not detected early. Early diagnosis significantly improves treatment options and patient outcomes. By integrating this model into healthcare systems, hospitals can:

- Revolutionize healthcare delivery.
- Provide proactive and precise treatment.
- Save countless lives by detecting tumors before significant harm occurs.

## Highlights üåü

- **Accuracy:** Achieved **97%** accuracy on training, **92%** on validation, and **88%** on the test set.
- **Efficiency:** The model uses only **4 million parameters**, making it lightweight and efficient for real-world deployment.

## Dataset

This project uses the **Kaggle Brain Tumor dataset**, which consists of MRI images classified into four categories. The dataset was accessed using the `opendatasets` library for seamless integration.

## Model Overview

- **Architecture:** A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for efficiency and performance.
- **Optimization:** Balances parameter count and accuracy for practical applications.
- **Performance:** The model delivers remarkable accuracy while maintaining a compact size.

## Results

| Metric      | Training | Validation | Testing |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------|
| **Accuracy** | 97%      | 92%        | 88%     |

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is preprocessed with normalization and augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
2. **Model Training:** The CNN model is trained using TensorFlow, focusing on minimizing loss while keeping the architecture lightweight.
3. **Evaluation:** The model is evaluated on training, validation, and test datasets, ensuring robustness.

## Challenges and Achievements

One of the most exhilarating challenges was engineering the **lightest weight model** possible without compromising accuracy. This was achieved through careful tuning of hyperparameters and architecture optimization.
